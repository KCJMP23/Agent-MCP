{#
    Note: Styles and Scripts blocks are handled by base.html including
    global_styles.html and scripts_footer.html by default.
    You could override these blocks here if this specific page needed
    additional page-specific styles or scripts, but for a single-page
    dashboard, keeping them global is simpler.
